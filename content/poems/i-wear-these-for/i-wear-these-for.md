i wear these for you to have forsaken the ways of the sea where the oxygen of blue slips through
my mai tai cocktail in an osmotic passage reaching. down molecules and entering in the code to
insert life because the concentration of humanity is imbalanced and the scales must be evened. i
wear these for you too open toe gladiator whose ends drag round my weak ankles to walk into
your den of lions, stumbling is no humiliation when i bare the burden of skin. i wear these for
you two the stilettoes of a double-fanged heel for which a skin was blacklisted and the entrance
now passcoded and encrypted it is my blistered place it is our pain to bear the next hackneyed
pace of this journey.
