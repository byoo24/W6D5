IMAGINE in this earth’s atmosphere,\
a bag filled with air travels slowly in\
the wind. On a jet stream, unearthly, air\
can travel at hundreds of miles per hour.\
Air can carry air very well.\
Air can carry a bag filled with air,\
a paper bag filled with not only air\
that doesn’t tear, a paper bomb filled with tears\
and mass panic. Just as well\
as a skin bag filled with air and manic\
sound and fury. If the bag slips below\
the jet stream, into the earth’s sphere,\
a pin releases and\
a smaller bag of sand is tossed off.
